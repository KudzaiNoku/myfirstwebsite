            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I’m currently in my 3rd year of university, studying a BSc, majoring in <strong>Computer Science and Computer Engineering</strong> at the University of Cape Town. Whether it’s figuring out tricky code, solving problems, or coming up with new ideas, I’m always eager to push my skills further. Outside of school, I’m constantly learning! I am currently completing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Codecademy’s "Build a Website with HTML, CSS, and GitHub Pages" course</li>
                    <li>Codecademy's Intermediate and Advanced Java courses</li>
                    <li>and I’m currently working through the "Front-end Engineer" career path.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>I’ve also been exploring <strong>Webflow</strong> and <strong>Figma</strong> to sharpen my design skills and stay on top of the latest web design trends.</p>

            <h2>What i'm up to...</h2>
            <p>I’m currently knee-deep in my university studies, but that doesn’t stop me from honing my skills whenever I can. I’m particularly passionate about mastering Java and front-end web development. My GitHub is home to a collection of projects I’ve completed for my computer science courses, and I’m adding more all the time as I take on personal challenges and new learning experiences.
                This website is a testament to my journey so far, and I’m excited to continue adding to it as I advance through my courses and projects. Expect to see more as I dive deeper into my studies and put what I’m learning into practice!</p>
